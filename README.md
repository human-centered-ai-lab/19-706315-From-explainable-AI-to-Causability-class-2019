# 19-706315-From-explainable-AI-to-Causability-class-2019
This is the class of 2019 of the course "From explainable AI to Causability"

MOTIVATION for this course:

This course is an extension of the last years “Methods of explainable AI”, which was a natural offspring of the interactive Machine Learning (iML) courses and the decision making courses held over the last years. Today the most successful AI/machine learning models, e.g. deep learning (see the difference AI-ML-DL) are often considered to be “black-boxes” making it difficult to re-enact and to answer the question of why a certain machine decision has been reached. A general serious drawback is that statistical learning models have no explicit declarative knowledge representation. That means such models have enormous difficulty in generating underlying explanatory structures. This limits their ability to understand the context.  Here the human-in-the-loop is exceptional good and as our goal is to augment the human intelligence with artificial intelligence we should rather speak of having a computer-in-the-loop. This is not necessary in some application domains (e.g. autonomous vehicles), but it is essential in our application domain, which is the medical domain (see our digital pathology project). A medical doctor is required on demand to retrace a result in an human understandable way. This calls not only for explainable models, but also for explanation interfaces (see AK HCI course). Interestingly, early AI systems (rule based systems) were explainiable to a certain extent within a well-defined problem space. Therefore this course will also provide a background on decision support systems from the early 1970ies (e.g. MYCIN, or GAMUTS of Radiology). In the class of 2019 we will focus even more on making inferences from observational data and reasoning under uncertainty which quickly bring us into the field of causality. Because in the biomedical domain (see e.g. our digital pathology project) we need to discover and understand unexpected interesting and relevant patterns in data to gain knowledge or for troubleshooting.

GOAL of this course:

This graduate course follows a research-based teaching (RBT) approach and provides an overview of selected current state-of-the-art methods on making AI transparent re-traceable, re-enactable, understandable, consequently explainable. Note: We speak Python.

TARGET group of this course:

Research students of  Computer Science particularly of the Holzinger group.
